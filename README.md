Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nadav Kahlon, an 18Â½-years-old undergraduate (senior) student at The Open University of Israel. I study Computer Science, and specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. During my years at The Open University of Israel, I received many awards for outstanding achievements, I even made it to the University's President's List twice.

I love computer science. Since youth I was amazed by the different aspects of this exciting field. To this day, I like doing research online, and then implementing my own projects from scratch. I like all different domains of the field of Computer Science, from the most theoretical ones (algorithms, the theory of computation, etc.) to the lowest-level aspects of computers (computer architecture, operating systems, etc.). I find them exciting, challenging, and fun. But one of them excites me the most - AI and machine learning. Therefore, I decided to specialize in it.

Everything I create I strive to make the best possible; in terms of performance, user convenience, high quality code, clearity, etc. I'm a real perfectionist!

Thanks for reading :)
